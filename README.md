# Kelp

## Overview

The goal is to make an easily-searchable database of seafood like that found in https://www.seafoodwatch.org/.


## Setup
Ensure that you have Python version >= 3.10.
If you have multiple versions of Python, specify a version >=3.10 by using `python3.x` and `pip3.x` where x is the version.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To activate the virtual environment (assuming you're developing on Mac): `source venv/bin/activate`

To deactivate: `deactivate`
